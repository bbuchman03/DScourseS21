\newline 8. best rmse = 0.05963623, in sample rmse I believe = 0.1695822
and out of sample = 0.1708259
\newline 9. best rmse = 1e-10, in sample rmse = 0.1845554 and out of sample = 0.1856365
\newline 10. I believe our model is pretty good but not fantastic. It could be made a lot better than it is. I don't know a reason why you couldn't do a simple linear regression, a rule is 10 observations per covariate.
